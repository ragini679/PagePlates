Experience:

Features Implemented:

Integration with MealDB API to fetch meal recipes.
Display of book and recipe details including images, ingredients, and descriptions.
Challenges Faced:
Dealing with limited API rate limits for the Google Books API.

Fetching book cover images from the Google Books API due to varying image sizes and formats, requiring additional handling for consistency.
